## Introduction

This is a Github repo for STATS220, taught by **Anna Fergusson** ([her profile](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-fergusson)) at the University of Auckland. The course outline for STATS220 can be found [here](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1243). 

*Note: I am taking this course alongside STATS101, which is another course that uses web apps made by Anna Fergusson. It's quite interesting to be taking these two courses alongside each other, to say the least :)*

## Key Topics

As taken from the digital course outline, the key topics covered in this course are:
* Creating HTML by combining modern technologies
* Creating web-based dynamic reporting systems
* Creating new variables and data structures
* Creating visual-based communications
* Creating data from digital sources
* Creating automated code-driven processes

## Why did I make this repo?

This repo is still very much a work-in-progress. Its purpose is to:

1. Record projects and labs done throughout the duration of the course.
2. Help me get used to Github, Git, and commits, etc.
3. Remind me of this course 5 years from now on!
